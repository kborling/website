      <description>Being self-employed and service based has been a rewarding experience, but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest.. it&amp;rsquo;s a constant grind.

This lack of consistency can be the deciding factor for most self-employed folks to throw in the towel and get a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; job (as my family would often remind me).</description>
