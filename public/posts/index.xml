            <description>Being self-employed and service based has been a rewarding experience, but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest.. it&amp;rsquo;s a constant grind. You are either swamped with work, or you are worrying about being homeless. Yes I am exaggerating a bit, but the point that I am trying to make is the lack of consistency. This lack of consistency can be the deciding factor for most self-employed folks to throw in the towel and get a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; job (as my family would often remind me).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being self-employed and service based has been a rewarding experience, but let&rsquo;s
be honest.. it&rsquo;s a constant grind. You are either swamped with work, or you are
worrying about being homeless. Yes I am exaggerating a bit, but the point that I
am trying to make is the lack of consistency. This lack of consistency can be
the deciding factor for most self-employed folks to throw in the towel and get a
&ldquo;real&rdquo; job (as my family would often remind me).</p>
<p>This brings me to my next point. The real challenge of being self-employed is
finding consistant work that meets your criteria for success. Here is what I
define as my criteria for success.</p>
<p>One of the things that I&rsquo;ve learned from the military is that I need structure..
a lot of it. Without it, I am all over the place and often feel dissatisfied with
my work days. I typically refer to these types of work days as &ldquo;no control??&quot;.</p>
<p>This led to feeling depressed and anxious because I wasn&rsquo;t getting
anything done in a realistic timeframe. Continuing</p>
<p>It becomes a negative feedback loop,
where the anxiety and depression pile on, along with the tasks at work.</p>
<h2 id="my-schedule">My Schedule</h2>
<p>I break up my typical workday (Monday-Friday) into blocks of time.</p>
<p>I found this method to be the most effective for me.
If I am able to follow this schedule, I maximize my productivity for the day.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect your internet</li>
<li>Block time wasters (any feed-based website)</li>
<li>Ditch the chair. Stand while you work (I use Autonomous) (Health benefits, energy levels, focus/attention increase)</li>
<li>Drink plenty of water</li>
<li>Drink coffee as needed (too much caffeine will kill your ability to focus, so
be aware of your limits)</li>
</ul>
