Being self-employed and service based has been a rewarding experience, but let's
be honest.. it's a constant grind and burnout can happen quick. You are either
swamped with work, or you are worrying about being homeless. Yes I am
exaggerating a bit, but the point that I am trying to make is the lack of
consistency. This lack of consistency can be the deciding factor for most
self-employed folks to throw in the towel and get a "real" job (as my family
would often remind me). 

This brings me to my next point. The real challenge of being self-employed is
finding consistant work that meets your criteria for success. Here is what I
define as my criteria for success.

One of the things that I've learned from the military is that I need structure..
a lot of it. Without it, I am all over the place and often feel dissatisfied with
my work days. I typically refer to these types of work days as "no control??". 

This led to feeling depressed and anxious because I wasn't getting
anything done in a realistic timeframe. Continuing 

It becomes a negative feedback loop,
where the anxiety and depression pile on, along with the tasks at work.

## My Schedule

I break up my typical workday (Monday-Friday) into blocks of time.


I found this method to be the most effective for me. 
If I am able to follow this schedule, I maximize my productivity for the day.

## Tips

* Disconnect your internet
* Block time wasters (any feed-based website)
* Ditch the chair. Stand while you work (I use Autonomous) (Health benefits, energy levels, focus/attention increase)
* Drink plenty of water
* Drink coffee as needed (too much caffeine will kill your ability to focus, so
  be aware of your limits)
