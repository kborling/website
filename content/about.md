Hi I'm Kevin. I am the owner of Kollab Innovations, a software development
company. I enjoy problem-solving and architecting solutions for real world
problems. Lately, I have put my focus towards learning bioinformatics, machine
learning, and blockchain. I am always learning a new language. Currently, I am
sharpening my Python skills and learning the ins and outs of Rust.

*Languages that I commonly work with and will most likely write about:*
- Golang
- Rust
- Python
- C/C++
- C#
- Java
- PHP
- Dart
- JavaScript
- Lisp

I am actively looking for free and open source projects to contribute to.

Follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/kborling) to see what I'm up to.
